## Quality Assurance & Testing

The Smarter Balanced Illustration Glossary Quality Assurance Checklist is intended to ensure third-party Test Delivery System (TDS) applications adhere to Smarter Balanced practices, standards, and guidelines that promote quality solutions. Even though this checklist covers mostly the functional aspects of the User Interface, it is recommended that the team developing this feature familiarize themselves with this checklist to ensure the developed application meets the quality standards.  

As part of the effort to assure consistency Smarter Balanced is providing the QA checklist below.  The checklist should be used as assurance that the Test Delivery System is capable of providing all of the functionality of the Illustration Glossaries:
