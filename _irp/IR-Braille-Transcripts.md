# Introduction

Smarter Balanced provides guidance and supporting tools to ensure the proper implementation of specific content and/or functionality. This page references all the documents, sample files, and QA guidelines to insure a reliable implementation of the delivery of Braille Transcripts in any Test Delivery System.

# Braille Transcripts Definition

Students with both visual and hearing impairments may benefit from Braille Transcripts of the Closed Captioning associated with an ELA/literacy listening passage. Smarter Balanced is releasing Braille Transcripts to provide supporting materials to students who are blind or visually impaired and deaf or hearing impaired. When a student with the Braille Transcript accommodation requests embossing of a listening passage, the introductory text of the passage is combined with the Closed Captioning transcript content and a single Braille (BRF) file is provided to the Test Administrator for embossing.

## Student and Test Administrator User Experience Workflows
 
The following document contains a definition of the Braille Transcripts functionality and a workflow of the user experiences involved in the process of taking and administering a test with Braille Transcripts. The document also has example step-by-step depictions of the user experiences as implemented in the Smarter Balanced Test Delivery System:
