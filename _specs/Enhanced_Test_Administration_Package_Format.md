The Enhanced Test Administration Package replaces the four previous test packages: Registration, Administration, Scoring, and Reporting. It contains all of the information necessary to present and score a test minus the test items themselves. The package is an XML file containing the following information:
* Test ID
* Test Name
* Blueprint
* Scoring Model
* Test Parts, Segments, and Segment Forms
* Test Item Metadata

The test administration package is paired with the test content package which contains the actual test items.

The enhanced test administration XSD file is at:
