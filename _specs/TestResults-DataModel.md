This specification defines the Data Dictionary and Logical Data Model for SmarterApp test results. This logical model is common for multiple data serialization formats including the [Test Results Transmission Format](/specs/TestResultsTransmissionFormat.html) the [Data Warehouse Data Specification for Student Assessments](/specs/DataWarehouse-DataSpec-StudentAssessments.html) and the [Data Warehouse Data Specification for Item Level Data](/specs/DataWarehouse-DataSpec-ItemLevel.html). The specification includes cross-references to these serialization formats and to the [Common Education Data Standards](http://ceds.ed.gov).
